# **DEVELOPER LOGS**

## **Project Overview**
This log tracks the development of an Asteroids-inspired 2D game using Unity Engine. Each stage is designed to ensure a structured and incremental approach to game creation.

---

## **Progress Summary**
### Last Update: December 28, 2024
- Completed Unity Project Setup.
- Created a basic 2D scene with a black background.

## **Game Plan**

### **Stage I: Core Setup**
- [x] Unity Project Setup - **Completed: December 28, 2024**
  - **Notes/Challenges**: Faced minor issues setting the proper project template; resolved by choosing the 2D Core option in Unity Hub.
- [x] Create 2D Scene with a black background - **Completed: December 28, 2024**
- [ ] Create a functioning main menu *(target: January 5, 2025)*.
  - **Notes**: Currently working on layout design with UI Toolkit.
- [ ] Create a functioning Game Over screen.
- [ ] Design and add a spaceship sprite.
- [ ] Implement player movement (forward thrust and rotation).
- [ ] Add player colliders and rigidbody components.
- [ ] Implement screen wrapping for the player.

---

### **Stage II: Basic Gameplay**
- [ ] Implement shooting mechanics.
  - [ ] Destroy bullets that leave the camera view.
- [ ] Add asteroids:
  - [ ] Create an asteroid sprite.
  - [ ] Make asteroids move on random trajectories.
- [ ] Implement collision detection:
  - [ ] Detect and handle asteroid-bullet collisions.
  - [ ] Detect and handle asteroid-spaceship collisions.

---

### **Stage III: Gameplay Loop**
- [ ] Implement asteroid splitting upon destruction.
- [ ] Add a lives system.
- [ ] Create a game management system:
  - [ ] Restart the game after all lives are lost.
  - [ ] Track and display both score and lives.
  - [ ] Add pause/unpause and restart functionality.

---

### **Stage IV: Visuals & Polish**
- [ ] Add simple particle effects for asteroid hits and splits.
- [ ] Add visual effects when the spaceship takes damage.
- [ ] Display scores and lives on the screen.
- [ ] Add sound effects for shooting, collisions, and explosions.

---

### **Stage V: Finishing Touches - Testing**
- [ ] Test and debug all mechanics.
- [ ] Fix edge cases (e.g., improper screen wrapping, collision issues).

---

### **Stage VI: Advanced Features (if time permits)**
- [ ] Add power-ups (e.g., shields, multi-shot, speed boost).
- [ ] Implement high-score tracking and display.

---

## **Learning and Reflections**
- **New Concepts Learned**: Documenting as the project progresses.
- **Improvements for Next Project**: Focus on modular development from the start.

---

## **Visual Progress**
- Screenshots and updates will be included here to showcase milestones visually.
